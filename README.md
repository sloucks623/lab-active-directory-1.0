# Active Directory Lab 1.0 (In Progress)

This project documents my journey building an enterprise-style Active Directory environment in VirtualBox. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with domain controllers, user and group management, and network security concepts commonly used in blue team operations.

I‚Äôm currently following a video tutorial series and building out each part step-by-step while documenting issues, lessons learned, and improvements along the way.

## Tools & Technologies

- VirtualBox
- Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller)
- Windows 10 (Domain-joined client)
- Kali Linux (for testing and simulation)
- Draw.io (topology diagramming)

---

## What This Lab Will Include

- Installing and configuring a domain controller (DC)
- Creating and managing user accounts in Active Directory
- Joining Windows 10 to the domain
- Simulating attacks using Kali Linux
- Testing detections and logging with built-in tools
- Possible integration of Atomic Red Team four testing

## Why I‚Äôm Building This Lab

As a cybersecurity student at WGU and a Navy veteran, I‚Äôm building this home lab to learn by doing. I want to show hiring managers that I‚Äôm serious about transitioning into blue team work, and that I understand how enterprise systems function under the hood.

## Status

**Currently working on:**  
- Creating the VirtualBox network  
- Installing Windows Server  
- Drafting the topology diagram  

More updates and screenshots will be added soon.

## Server Install Notes (Student/Home Setup)

This lab uses the **free evaluation version** of Windows Server ‚Äî legal and fully functional for 180 days. No license or enterprise resources are required.

> Note: Although the tutorial mentions Server 2019, the system may display Windows Server 2022 depending on the image used. This lab follows the 2019-based layout.

### Download Link:
[Windows Server Evaluation Center (Microsoft)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server)

- Recommended: **Windows Server 2019 ISO** (Standard Desktop Experience)

---

### Step-by-Step: Installing Windows Server in VirtualBox

1. **Create VM**
   - Name: `WinServer2019`
   - Type: `Microsoft Windows`
   - Version: `Windows 2019 (64-bit)`
   - RAM: 4096 MB (or more)
   - Virtual hard disk: VDI, dynamically allocated, at least 50 GB

2. **Mount ISO**
   - Go to VM settings ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Add ISO under Controller: IDE
   - Select the downloaded `.iso` file

3. **Start the VM and Install**
   - Choose: **Windows Server 2019 Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience)**
   - Select ‚ÄúCustom Install‚Äù
   - Format the disk and proceed with installation

4. **Initial Setup**
   - After first reboot, set the local Administrator password
   - Skip license key ‚Äî the Eval version activates automatically (180-day watermark)
