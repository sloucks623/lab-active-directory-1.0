# Active Directory Lab 1.0

This lab simulates a basic Windows Active Directory environment for home lab training. It’s designed to demonstrate core AD setup including domain creation, DNS/DHCP configuration, user/group management, and structured documentation — all built locally using free tools.

## Lab Goals

- Set up a virtualized AD Domain Controller using Windows Server 2019
- Configure DNS and DHCP within the domain
- Create and organize Organizational Units (OUs)
- Add users and security groups manually
- Visualize and document the topology using draw.io

---

## Tools Used

- VirtualBox (hosted on Windows 11 Pro)
- Windows Server 2019 ISO
- Windows 10 ISO (client)
- draw.io (for network diagrams)
- Optional: Kali Linux and Ubuntu Server (future phases)

## Phase Summary

**Phase 1 – Core Build (Complete)**
- Domain Controller with DNS/DHCP successfully configured
- Windows 10 client added to domain
- Basic user and OU structure created
- First diagram embedded above

**Phase 2 – Expansion (In Progress)**
- Second diagram being designed
- Screenshots, ADUC examples, and group policy testing coming
- Will document realistic user hierarchy and group structure

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Installed and configured Windows Server AD from scratch
- Practiced DNS and DHCP service setup in a domain
- Gained experience managing users, groups, and OUs
- Built diagrams to represent lab network and system relationships
- Documented a working example suitable for resume/portfolio use
