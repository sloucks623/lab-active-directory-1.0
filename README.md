# Active Directory Lab 1.0 (In Progress)

This project documents my journey building an enterprise-style Active Directory environment in VirtualBox. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with domain controllers, user and group management, and network security concepts commonly used in blue team operations.

I’m currently following a video tutorial series and building out each part step-by-step while documenting issues, lessons learned, and improvements along the way.

## Why I’m Building This Lab

As a cybersecurity student at WGU and a Navy veteran, I’m building this home lab to learn by doing. I want to show hiring managers that I’m serious about transitioning into blue team work, and that I understand how enterprise systems function under the hood.

## Status

**Currently working on:**  
- Creating the VirtualBox network  
- Installing Windows Server  
- Drafting the topology diagram  

More updates and screenshots will be added soon.
