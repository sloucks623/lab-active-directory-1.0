# Active Directory Lab 1.0 â€“ Red vs Blue Lab Environment

This lab is built following the MyDFIR YouTube tutorial series. It simulates a real-world enterprise environment for practicing Blue Team defense, Red Team tactics, and centralized SIEM logging, using a variety of open-source and enterprise-grade tools.

---

## Lab Topology

> *[Custom network diagram will be inserted here later]*

This lab consists of four virtual machines connected in an isolated VirtualBox Internal Network (`10.0.0.0/24`):

- **Windows Server 2019 (DC01)**: Domain Controller running AD DS and DNS services
- **Windows 10 Pro (WIN10)**: Blue Team client machine joined to the domain
- **Kali Linux**: Red Team attacker box for network recon and attack emulation
- **Ubuntu Server 22.04 (SIEM01)**: Centralized logging server using Wazuh or Splunk

These VMs simulate a Red vs Blue scenario with log correlation, GPO enforcement, and adversary simulation tooling.

## Red Team & SIEM Components

- **Red Team (Kali):**
  - Tools: Nmap, CrackMapExec, Impacket, Responder, SMBClient, BloodHound (optional)
  - Adversary simulation: [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) used to trigger defensive detection logic

- **Blue Team (WIN10 + DC01):**
  - Tools: Group Policy Management Console, Event Viewer, PowerShell, RDP
  - Tasks: Enforce password and logon policies, monitor group membership and authentication behavior

- **SIEM/EDR (Ubuntu):**
  - Tools: Wazuh or Splunk, Log forwarders (Winlogbeat/NXLog), Sysmon
  - Role: Monitor and correlate Windows event logs, detect Atomic Red Team tests, visualize attacker patterns
