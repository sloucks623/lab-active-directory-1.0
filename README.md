## Overview

This lab follows the [Myfdir Active Directory YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/@myfdir) to build a basic enterprise Active Directory environment. It simulates a small internal network using VirtualBox, with a domain controller (Windows Server 2019) and a Windows 10 client.

---

## Lab Objectives

- [ ] Install and configure a Windows Server 2019 domain controller (DC01)
- [ ] Set static IP, hostname, and promote to a domain controller
- [ ] Install and configure DNS and DHCP
- [ ] Create Organizational Units (OUs), users, and groups
- [ ] Join Windows 10 client to the domain (WIN10)
- [ ] Apply and verify Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
